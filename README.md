# AWS Cloud Practitioner — A Study Manual

You can view the Netcom Learning [YouTube tutorial]. This was a short video but thorough, and it provided me with a comprehensive overview of AWS's offerings.

I visited their website and checked out the AWS courses that they were providing. 

If you're like me and don't know where to begin, I highly recommend going through [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Training]  as a good starting point.

## Practice the examinations as much as you can. 

Following that, I sought and finished as many free exam questions as I could find online. Make sure to start with the one given by Netcom Learning. 
•	Last but not least, and most importantly for me, I must finish the whole course given by the training centers for this test, as well as the practice paper. 
•	I made a point of supplementing my existing knowledge with material from the training. 
•	Once you've completed that, run a couple more exams, and you're ready to book your exam!

### Here are some of the issues that were discussed.

•	Their billing and pricing structure is critical.
•	Ensure that you thoroughly comprehend the 'well architect framework,' trusted adviser service, and cloud adoption framework (I suggest going all out and memorizing all the non-technical information as they are probably the easiest to take advantage of).
•	Understand their global architecture, EC2, S3, relational and non-relational databases, serverless computing, automation, cloud migration, and so on.
•	Use your knowledge to practice scenario-based questions. Keep in mind which service is ideal for a specific situation.

## Structure of the examination

#### The following is the exam structure:

•	There is one correct response and three wrong replies in a multiple-choice question.
•	Multiple answers: Has two or more accurate answers out of five or more possibilities.
•	It is a pass/fail exam, with a minimum of 70% accurate responses required to pass. I was given 65 questions to answer.

You will not be punished for answering a question wrong. Therefore, it is preferable to guess rather than leave it blank if you genuinely do not know the answers.
You won't be able to discover the identical questions that will appear on the test online, but you will find comparable ones.
Best wishes to anybody intending to take the [AWS cloud practitioner] test shortly!
